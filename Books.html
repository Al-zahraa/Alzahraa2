				A Novel by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell " target="_blank">George orwell</a> Originally published: August 17, 1945 is set in 1984 in Oceania, one of three perpetually warring totalitarian states (the other two are Eurasia and Eastasia). Oceania is governed by the all-controlling Party, which has brainwashed the population into unthinking obedience to its leader, Big Brother. The Party has created a propagandistic language known as Newspeak, which is designed to limit free thought and promote the Party’s doctrines. Its words include doublethink (belief in contradictory ideas simultaneously), which is reflected in the Party’s slogans: “War is peace,” “Freedom is slavery,” and “Ignorance is strength.” The Party maintains control through the Thought Police and continual surveillance.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four"  target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p>
